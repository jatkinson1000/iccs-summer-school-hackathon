## Project overview

The repository uses the [PDAF](https://pdaf.awi.de) data assimilation framework
to perform data assimilation on the Lorenz ‘96 model in the context of a machine
learning based surrogate model.
Observations are generated using a Python implementation of the model.
The surrogate model is written in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and this is
ported to Fortran for use with PDAF using
[FTorch](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/FTorch/).
